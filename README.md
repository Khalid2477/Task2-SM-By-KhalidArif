# Task2-SM-By-KhalidArif

Task 2 for Smart Methods summer training 2021 done by Khalid Arif,

I have created this project as my second task in my summer training at Smart Methods.

I have also created a html and php and have learned new ways to use it.

I created a direction interface where depends on the direction chosen it will be uploaded in the database.

I have also created a main page for both of my tasks that can used to control either of the interfaces.
